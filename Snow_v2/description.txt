Snow Benchmark: Creates different render extensions based on the screen and has them fall from top to bottom. Provides the frame rate in the top left of the screen.

Each render extension is created based on pseudo random numbers; a seed can be entered to get consistent results or the system time can be used (defaults to static seed of 1). 
The controls will be created at different times based on the generated number and will have different ‘X’ positions based on the number.
Each screen will generate the controls at the same positions and same relative times, entering a seed or leaving the system time to be used does not change this.
