FallingObjects: Tests engine performance of objects doing a simple motion (going from the top of the screen to the bottom) using multiple copies of each object, using a variety of different render extensions and parameters.

Each screen has multiple versions as follows:
    - Event driven movement, objects fall from top to bottom, with redraws driven by events
    - Animation driven movement, objects fall from top to bottom, redraws and frame rate set
    - Without alpha blending, object alpha set to 255
    - With alpha blending, object alpha set to 127
    - Without rotation, objects fall with angle of 0
    - With rotation, objects fall with angle set to 45*

*Not including text, which only accepts rotations that are multiples of 90
Text therefore sets its angle to 90

Each screen will repeat the process of objects falling multiple times, each time doubling the number of objects.
